## README: MPU6050 Yaw Reader with Wire.h

**Purpose:**

This Arduino code provides a basic implementation for reading yaw from an MPU6050 Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) using the I2C interface and the `Wire.h` library.

**Prerequisites:**

- An Arduino board compatible with I2C communication (e.g., Arduino Uno, Mega).
- An MPU6050 IMU module connected to the Arduino's I2C pins (SDA and SCL).
- The `Wire.h` library included in your Arduino IDE.

**Installation:**

1. **Clone or download:** Download this repository or copy the code directly into your Arduino IDE.
2. **Include header:** Include the `Wire.h` library at the beginning of your code.

**Usage:**

1. **Upload code:** Upload the code to your Arduino board.
2. **Open serial monitor:** Open the serial monitor in your Arduino IDE at a baud rate of 9600.
3. **View yaw data:** The serial monitor will display the calculated yaw angle in degrees.

**Customization:**

- **Complementary filter:** Adjust the `alpha` value in the `loop()` function to balance between gyroscope and accelerometer data.
- **Calibration:** Calibrate the MPU6050 to ensure accurate readings.
- **Error handling:** Implement error handling mechanisms to check for I2C communication errors and handle unexpected data.
- **Data types:** Ensure that data types are appropriate for the calculations to avoid overflow or underflow.

**Additional Notes:**

- The code assumes that the MPU6050 is connected to the default I2C address (`0x68`). If your MPU6050 has a different address, modify the `MPU6050_ADDR` constant accordingly.
- This code provides a basic implementation and may require modifications for specific applications or more advanced features.
